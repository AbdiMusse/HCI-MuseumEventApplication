PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This is my first application that I built using C# which was for one of my assignments in my first year of computer science. I received 88% for this project. Both the code and the report has been added to this repository.

The goal of this application was to apply techniques for analysing human-computer interaction and to demonstrate my knowledge of basic user interface programming techniques. The application revolved around designing a solution for a science museum computer system which allows the general public to search for information about exhibits such as location and register their interest on artefact related sessions and workshops.

Feel free to have a look around and contact me, leave comments or issue requests with things I could have done better - I'm all about learning how to write better code.
